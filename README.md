# Bengaluru Housing Price Prediction 🏘️📈

This project uses machine learning to predict housing prices in Bengaluru, India. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a regression model to estimate property prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bathrooms, and more.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Bangaluru Housing Price prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow, from data cleaning to model deployment.
- `bangalore.csv` *(if applicable)*: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `model.pkl`: Saved machine learning model (optional, if exported).
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## 📊 Features Used

- Location
- Size (BHK)
- Total square feet
- Number of bathrooms
- Price per square foot

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bangalore-housing-price-prediction.git
   cd bangalore-housing-price-prediction
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Launch the notebook:
   jupyter notebook
4. Open Bangaluru Housing Price prediction.ipynb and run all cells.

🧠 Model
    A linear regression model was trained after preprocessing steps like:

    Handling outliers

    Dimensionality reduction for location

    Feature engineering

✅ Future Improvements
Incorporate more features like amenities or locality scores

Use advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest)

Deploy the model via a web app (Streamlit or Flask)
The model performance was evaluated using metrics like R² score and RMSE.
